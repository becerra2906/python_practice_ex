# First, create a variable called start, and set it equal to "I am ".
# Remember the space after the word "am" !


# Next, create a variable called age and set it equal to your age in years.
# This must be a number


# Next, create a variable called end, and set it equal to " years old".
# Remember the space before the word "years"


# Next, create a variable called output and use {} symbols and the format() function to stick the start, age and end variables
# together to make a string.

# An example output string would be "I am 15 years old"


# Finally, print the output to the screen using the print() function.

start = "I am "
age = 25
end = " years old"

output = "{} {} {}".format(start, str(age), end)
print(output)
